              <h2><center>Unexpected Links</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; In the land of heartbreaks and misery lived a couple of pure souls - Ira Jain and Harsh Gupta. So, let us begin this story from the very start to understand better how they both were linked to each other and how this would turn out to be the most unexpected and incredible love story in the history of humankind. <br><br>
                &#8688; If I may ask, what is the most unexpected relationship a couple might have shared in the past before they became ONE? I am sure many weird answers might have popped up in your mind, but none compares to the one shared by the characters in our story. So, let's not keep you guys waiting and just spill the tea right away. Ira was Harsh’s best friend, Aryan’s ex-girlfriend. That’s right! You guys can take a break if you please to digest this.
                To make matters worse, Harsh broke up very recently and was still recovering from the post-relationship trauma. Ira and Aryan broke up in March and had been on and off after that, but never entirely off the table. Harsh and Ira knew each other but only as what was portrayed by Aryan and were a mere gossip topic for each other.  </p>

              <h2><center> And it Begins </center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; It all started on the 16th of December when a troubled and hopeless Ira thought of contacting Harsh. Ira and Aryan were fighting that day, and during their heated argument, Aryan confessed to having feelings for his best friend, Devu. This claim wholly shattered Ira and left her heartbroken. Aryan had in the past warned her many times never to contact Harsh. So, this was Ira’s last resort, but that day, she had no other option, and so very reluctantly, she messaged him asking if she could have a moment of his time as she wanted to talk. Harsh was more than willing to talk and asked her to call him on WhatsApp. They ended up talking for almost 2 hours that day, and it was the turning point in their life. They both were unaware, but they had just started a relationship that would end up turning their lives upside down for good, forever and ever. <br><br>
                &#8688; Harsh told Aryan about all this the very next day. To his surprise, Aryan reacted very subtly and asked him to talk to her every day for some days as he wasn’t up for the responsibility. Harsh complied and assured him that he would take care of her. <br><br>
                &#8688; That afternoon, Harsh was going to college when he had the sudden urge of checking up on Ira. He just wanted to show his care for her. Little did he know that this checkup call was going to go a long way in bringing them together. They ended up talking for almost an hour again. Harsh was receiving many calls while they were talking, and his entire badminton team, along with their coach, were waiting for him, but he did not pick up any calls as he was too engrossed talking to her.  There was something about her that always attracted him. Maybe her vibe or her personality, Harsh was still figuring out.  </p>
          </li>

              <h2><center>They come close</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; Ira had blocked Aryan from all the places, so he had no way of contacting her. So, Aryan told Harsh to ask Ira to call him, which he did. This request was the first time he felt weird about the entire situation. A part of him did not want her to call Aryan. But he could not gather to courage to say this to Ira. To his surprise, Ira herself asked him if she should call him. There were these little butterflies in his stomach, but he managed to suppress them, well, at least for now. Harsh told her to call him and ask what he had to say, which she did, and as expected, he lashed out at her for contacting Harsh. Not only this, he went as far as saying a lot of unexpected and bad things about Harsh’s personality and character. As soon as their call ended, Ira called Harsh and told him everything. Well, not exactly everything, but surely enough for him to realise that Aryan isn’t the true friend he thinks he is. This revelation came out as a shocker for Harsh as he always believed that Aryan was his go-to person. He was unaware that this was just the tip of the iceberg, and there was a lot more he was going to find out from thereon. <br><br>
                &#8688; As the days went by,  Harsh and Ira continued talking, which became routine. So, they started having this bizarre arrangement where they used to act like strangers during the daytime and would end up talking the entire night. It was usually Ira who used to text Harsh at night for some reason or the other. Also, during this time, Harsh had started realising that he had no way out and he was eventually going to fall for her, and it was just a matter of time. He could not keep himself away from her. Seeing her in pain used to trouble him as well, and all he could think was only if I had you, I’d show you what you’re worth! Oh, common, don’t judge him already; after all, he was still unaware that he’d get the chance to express his love to her. Harsh started having lengthy conversations about her with his closest friend from college, Pranav. They both stalked her private account together, where Harsh found himself practically drooling over a recent picture that she had uploaded. He had started realising that he was almost fucked in this situation that he was in because he was going to lose out on something for sure, either his best friend or potential love of his life. But at the same time, he knew that there was nothing he could do about it because he was so attracted to her that even if he tried staying away from her, he could not and found himself going closer. <br><br>
                &#8688; On the night of 22nd December, Ira did not text Harsh, and that is when he realised how badly he missed her and wanted to talk to her. He was debating whether or not he should text her. So after an hour of procrastinating, he eventually did, and to his surprise, she had already opened his chat head as she instantly read his message. This coincidence freaked him out as the telepathic connection became even more evident. They ended up talking that night as well, and this also became the first night when they jokingly discussed them being a couple. For Ira, all these conversations were instead a way to distract her mind off Aryan as she was still not over him. But for Harsh, these conversations had a much deeper meaning.</p>

              <h2><center>Ira’s Trip to Delhi</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; On 23rd December, Ira told Harsh that she was coming to Delhi to meet one of her friends who was leaving for Canada. Harsh explicitly asked her if she had any plans of meeting Aryan. She said no, claiming that Aryan did not even know she was coming the next day. 
                &#8688; The next day rolled up, and Harsh had gone to college that day. He was returning when he received a text from Ira telling him that she would meet Aryan. It startled Harsh and bothered him. A part of him screamed in agony and wanted to shout at her for doing this. But, he knew that he did not have the right to do so then. So, he suppressed all his feelings and wished her luck. He called Aryan right after this to see if he had told him about this plan. To his surprise, he did not, and this bothered Harsh. He was practically standing at a point where he was getting more information about his supposed best friend from his ex-girlfriend. They met at Starbucks, Cannaught Place, which was their go-to location. Harsh was expecting to hear from Ira after their meeting, but unexpectedly, he did not. All this left him puzzled about what went down when they met. But all his questions had to wait as he did not hear from Ira even at night. It made him fear the unthinkable. He started thinking that they got back together and he was going to lose the love of his life to some other person, and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it. <br><br>
                &#8688; Christmas came by, and although Santa Claus did not show up, he did send some good news for Harsh. He received a text from Ira wishing him a Merry Christmas. It was a sigh of relief for him as at least now he could ask what happened yesterday. She told him that nothing significant had happened. Aryan did ask her to come back to him, but she was adamant that she would not give in this easily. He promised her that he would block the girl responsible for causing many problems in their relationship. But by this time, Ira wanted more. These days that she spent talking to Harsh had instilled in her that she should not settle for anything less than perfect because she deserves every bit of it. The least she wanted was assurance from Aryan that he would stick by and something like this would not happen in the future. Aryan refused to give her this promise, which made her walk out on him. Hearing this was nothing less than a Christmas miracle for Harsh. He was on cloud nine, and it did not go well. <br><br>
                &#8688; Aryan was practically pushing Ira from himself and into Harsh’s arms. After all this went down the previous day, he dared to plan an outing with Devu on Christmas Day. They first went to watch a movie together. He called Ira up from the washroom of the movie theatre, where she got to know that he was out with Devu. It pissed her off, and she politely asked him to be back by evening as she was not comfortable with him spending that much time with Devu. Ira texted Harsh around 7:30 and told him that she received a call from Devu asking her to talk to Aryan as he was crying. She called Aryan up, but he did not answer. So, she called Devu back and got some lame responses telling her that it was a prank and nothing was going on. This pissed her off, and to top it off, she was scared that Aryan might end up going partying or clubbing with Devu. Harsh was in a terrible state here as he already knew Aryan’s plans, but he had to play it cool and act aloof in front of Ira. All this was eating him inside out as it was so easy for him to rat out Aryan and expose him. But he decided against it and kept it a secret. Around 10 p.m, she received a text from Aryan’s phone claiming that it was Devu and that Aryan got drunk and passed out at her place. She asked her to wake him up, which she ignored. She even called her up and asked her to wake him up as she desperately wanted to talk to him. Ira faced a series of insulting and insensitive replies. It broke her and made her feel extremely humiliated. She confided in Harsh by telling her all this. It was difficult for him to keep his mouth shut and see her in that state. It was the first time Harsh had seen her breaking down. She called him up and disintegrated. She was anxious, out of breath and having the worst panic attack of her life. He comforted her by making her realise that she was not alone in this and he was there for her. She had to take her anxiety pills that day to sleep. Aryan came back home and confessed that he was lying and clubbing. It served as one of the worst nights of her life as she had one bad experience after the other.</p>

              <h2><center>Things worsened b/w AJ& IJ</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; Their fight continued the next day as well. Aryan apologised for what he had done, but Ira had had enough this time. She was in no mood to entertain him and did not believe what he said. The constant bickering had left her with no energy to fight. What she did not at that time was that the next day was going to turn out to be even worse. <br><br>
                &#8688; That day started just like the last one, constant fighting and arguing. Harsh had his presentation that day, and so he was in college. Around 3 p.m, he was out with his friends when he received a text from Ira telling him that Aryan had crossed all lines that day. So, Harsh called her up and asked her what the matter was. She said to him that she was again willing to accept Aryan back if he blocked Devu till 3 p.m and came back to her. Harsh was heartbroken at this point because he was in a mood to see her hurt again. Aryan replied that he would not block Devu or let her go. It infuriated Ira and made her give a very generic statement which went like - “I feel like hanging myself”. No one knows what frame of mind was Aryan in that he took that seriously and ended up calling Ira’s mom. She was in her office when she received the call, and Aryan went on to tell her that Ira was planning to hang herself because their ‘friendship’ had ended. She asked Aryan to not contact Ira after this. She rushed back home and went straight to her room. She asked Ira first to shoot her and then herself. Naturally, she was agitated and angry. She told Ira that she was not going to go to her office and would hand over her resignation as she could not deal with all this at the same time. It made Ira feel guilty about everything. After all, no matter what we do, we never want our parents to face something like this. It was her breaking point. She was officially done with Aryan and did not want anything to do with him moving forward. She called him up and asked him to delete all their pictures together, and that too in the presence of Harsh as she did not trust him enough. Harsh could not believe what had just happened. He called Aryan up, and he told him about the entire incident. He asked Aryan what was he thinking involving her family in this. He was very disappointed. But a part of him was low key happy that this happened because now he knew that there was no going back. Even if Ira forgives him, she would have difficulty convincing her parents about him. Anyway, he supported Ira through this and assured her that everything would be okay. They talked for a long time that day as well. By this time, their conversations had a lot of flirting elements as well. It was primarily Harsh who hit on her, but she did not back off either. They were yet to realise that all this flirting had a greater meaning to it, and all these little jokes here and there carried a lot of weightage and hidden feelings that they were trying to suppress.  </p>

              <h2><center>Happy New Year</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; Nothing eventful happened for a couple of days. Harsh and Ira grew closer. They had this peculiar cycle where they did not talk the entire day and ended up being on call from 12 to 4 every night. It bugged Ira as she wondered where he was the whole day. Harsh, on the other hand, was playing some mind games. He wanted to give her time to miss him, so he did not speak to her during the daytime. By this time, he was sure about his feelings and wanted to express them to her desperately. He did want to take it slow as he did not want to overwhelm her. The low key flirting was not that low key now. They used to admit about missing each other openly and how it felt weird not talking the entire day. There were still a few bumps along the way. So, one fine night they were talking when suddenly Ira started ranting about how she still misses him and how she badly wants to give him a proper goodbye. She asked Harsh to do her a favour and bring Aryan to Meerut once so that she could hug him, hear his heartbeat and give him a farewell. It made Harsh jealous to an unimaginable extent. <br><br>
                &#8688; There was a voice inside of him shouting and screaming in pain. He so wanted to express how he felt about her and ask her to shut the fuck up and forget Aryan. But, he could not do it and complied with what she said. He very diligently passed on her message to Aryan and even tried to convince him to visit Meerut once for all time sake. Aryan said he would not go but asked him to lie to her, saying he would try to come on the 31st. With a heavy heart, he did as asked. It was tough to see Ira having that glimmer of hope that he would come when he would never make it in reality. <br><br>
                &#8688; Anyway, the 31st of December rolled by. Ira decided to call Aryan for this one last time to say goodbye and wish him luck. She was a hundred per cent sure that this would be the last time she was entertaining him. She called him up, and they ended up talking for a couple of hours. During this entire time, Aryan was more concerned about what Harsh used to say to Ira rather than focusing on talking about themselves. He disrespected Harsh and made all sorts of allegations, calling him names and speaking ill of him. Ira found this weird as she wanted to focus this conversation on Ira and Aryan rather than Harsh. Harsh was taken aback by this as he did not expect this from Aryan, but it also helped him not to care anymore. Incidents like this did fuel his desire to go for what he was feeling without overthinking about his friend because, after all, he might not be what Harsh thinks he is. <br><br>
                &#8688; Harsh and Ira got over this quickly and started focusing on their New Year’s plans. Harsh had his cousins coming over, and Ira was supposed to go to a party at a friend’s place. Both of them planned to get drunk that day. Harsh made a deal with Ira that they got a free pass tonight. Whatever they said that day would not be accounted for, and they could just pour their heart out. He even wrote a long text message for her. He was anxious about sending that message because he was unsure if she was ready for it. As midnight approached, both of them got engaged in their plans. She had a few drinks and then told Harsh that she would no longer cry for Aryan and it was time to make him cry. The New year rolled in and brought a complete change of mindset. It was a magical night that got them very close. <br><br>
                &#8688; Soon after that, Harsh got sloshed himself to pour his heart out in front of her. She called him as soon as she reached home and was pretty drunk at that time. Harsh said many things that day, for the very first time. He confessed how much she meant to him and how he could not bear the sight of her crying. Harsh even told her how much he misses her when they cannot talk and tried to extract things from her. She did confess that she used to stalk him on Whatsapp to see if he was online or not, and if he was, she wondered who in the world he was talking to. They ended up having a long and tempting conversation that day. She warned Harsh that if he even dared to take anything away from her, then she would put his head through a wall. All in all, it served as a significant event that helped both of them to open up truly.</p>

              <h2><center>On to Good Times</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; The conversation they had that night was significant for Harsh. He was on cloud nine as he just got that sort of confirmation that even he meant a lot to her. He did not know where this was going, but he was excited about how things were going. So, the following day when they woke up, he expected to have a conversation regarding this. But to his surprise, Ira claimed that she did not remember most of the conversation and was embarrassed in knowing what went down. It startled him as he started questioning everything that happened last night. She threatened to ghost him if she said something she should not have. It pissed him off, and he told her that she did something like that, so now she should try and ghost him. They ended up playing this game where they both would try not to contact each other and see which one gave up first. A part of both of them did not want to get involved in this game, but somehow they did. As soon as the game started, Harsh started having a million questions in his mind. He texted his best friend, Pranav, about his fears. He thought, what if it does not affect her and if she is okay not talking to him. Little did he know, by this time, even Ira had become used to having him around. So not even after 3 hours of them starting this game, she called him and accepted her defeat. She was pissed as she had to take her guard down first. It made him feel special as now all his apprehensions were clear. </p>

              <h2><center>The confession</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; On the 2nd of January, Aryan called Ira up many times. She was in no mood to entertain him, so she did not answer for a long time. She asked Harsh about what she should do in such a situation. Harsh did not want her to engage in any conversation with him but had no choice but to ask her to talk to him. She called him, and they again spoke for a few minutes. Just as their call ended, Aryan called Harsh and asked him to stop talking to Ira. It was Harsh’s worst nightmare coming true. Until now, he was just hiding things from Aryan. But now, he was faced with the choice he dreaded the most. He had to make a call outright if he wanted to let go of the love of his life but a dying friendship or not. He did not have any double thoughts, even for a second. He called Ira up and told her about what had unfolded. She acted very aloof and tried to play it off very calmly as she did not want to influence his decision in any way. A part of her was telling her that he would choose her, but she did not want to get disappointed, so she played it safe and left the choice entirely on him. Harsh was in tears when even the thought of him losing her crossed his mind. He told her very explicitly that he was ready to leave the world for her and that he had started loving her. It caught her by surprise as she was not expecting this at all. They both got engaged in an intense and heart to heart conversation. By the end of it, it was pretty clear that he was not going anywhere and that he was going to stick by her. He asked her to fight off her feelings for him for as long as she could do so. It was because he did not want her to give in as a moment of weakness. Instead, he wanted her to fight the urge for as long as possible. It was the night Harsh confessed everything he had for her, and they both ended up envisioning their future together. By the end of the night, they both were drooling for each other, knowing very well that something was brewing up here. </p>

              <h2><center>Meerut, you beauty</center></h2><hr />
              <p>&#8688; The back and forth flirting got severe over the next couple of days. There was something going on, and both of them acknowledged it. Their conversations did take a bit of a romantic turn. Ira was still unsure of all the big things that Harsh was promising to give her. So, to prove his point and worth, Harsh decided to take some action. He decided to surprise her by going to Meerut. She had once told him that she loved tea cake. So, he left his home on the 5th of December, he left his home and went straight to a bakery. He picked up a tea cake and some macaroons. He reached Meerut and called her up, asking her to come out of her house as a delivery person was standing outside. She asked him to give her his number, so it did not really work out, and eventually, he just had to blurt it out in front of her that the delivery boy was none other than her very own Harsh! She was shocked and could not believe it. They went out to grab a quick bite. She was timid and unable to make any eye contact. Harsh took the initiative and held her hand for a couple of minutes. As they left the cafe, she hugged him and thanked him for coming this far. She told him that this meant a lot to her. Although she could not confess it, she knew that she had started feeling something for this guy. She now started believing everything that Harsh said to her. He did make her feel like the most special girl on planet Earth because, for him, she indeed was the entire planet Earth.  <br><br>
                &#8688; It marked the onset of their relationship. Harsh and Ira both knew that they had each other now and forever. It was the beginning of the most beautiful relationship on the face of the planet. </p>
